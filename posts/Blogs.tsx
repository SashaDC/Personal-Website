    description:
      'This post reflects on how my background and experiences shaped my values, strengths, limitations, and lessons that I’ll carry forward as I grow in software development.',
    content: (
      <>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Ethical Decision</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          To be honest, I haven't really faced a situation where I had to make
          an ethical decision and weigh the options. Being still quite young, I
          haven’t had many experiences that required this level of reflection.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">
          Cultural Influence and Identity
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I’m Pākehā and grew up in Whangarei. My upbringing was in a somewhat
          large and dysfunctional family, with my parents separating before I
          could even remember. By the time I was halfway through intermediate
          school, I had become self-reliant and a bit closed off due to neglect
          from both parents.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          During high school, I built a good friend group that influenced me to
          value companionship, honesty, and integrity—values I continue to
          uphold to this day.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Strengths</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
          <li>Adaptability: Able to adjust to my surrounding environment.</li>
          <li>
            Analytical/Critical Problem-solving: Skilled at identifying and
            resolving problems effectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            Honesty and Integrity: Willing to take accountability and admit to
            mistakes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          These strengths will help me navigate the challenges of learning
          software development and stay focused on my coursework throughout the
          year.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Limitations</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
          <li>Forgetfulness</li>
          <li>Procrastination</li>
          <li>
            Neurotic tendencies: Overthinking and worrying, as highlighted in an
            “Academic Strengths and Weaknesses” Q&A.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          These limitations can sometimes cloud my focus and create self-doubt.
          However, I am committed to overcoming these challenges as I progress
          through my learning journey.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">
          Working Productively with Others
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          One example of working with others under tension comes from my work
          experience as a supervisor. I had two coworkers who were decent people
          but tended to slack off, which increased my workload.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">I tried to address the issue by:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
          <li>Discussing the problem directly with them.</li>
          <li>
            Experimenting with strategies such as working alongside them or
            separating them to improve focus.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Although they initially agreed, the plan was largely ignored after a
          few weeks, leading to an entire department meeting.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Reflecting on this, I realize I may have been too lenient, as I had
          just become a supervisor and could have enforced expectations more
          firmly. At the time, there weren’t many strategies I could employ,
          since the only person they responded to was our manager.

        <h3 className="font-semibold">Long-Term Goal / Career Pathway</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Although I'm not entirely sure on the exact destination or impact I'd
          want to make in the future, I hope to use the skills I gain from this
          course to find a decent, well-paying job that allows me to grow as a
          developer.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold">Strengths and Limitations</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          My strengths haven't really changed since Sprint 2, but I've worked on
          overcoming my limitations and have improved on procrastination,
          focusing more effectively on my tasks.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold">Biggest Non-Technical Challenge</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The biggest non-technical challenge I expect is working and speaking
          in front of a group.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold">Human Skills to Develop</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I aim to develop skills such as giving and receiving feedback,
          leadership, and improving self-awareness and reflective practices.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold">Expectations from the Bootcamp Team</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I expect guidance and support similar to what I anticipated from the
          Facilitation team previously.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold">Expectations of Myself</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I expect to stay on top of my workload by limiting distractions,
          working productively, and maintaining professional and respectful
          relationships with other learners, facilitators, and
          industry/community representatives.

        <h3 className="font-semibold">Long-Term Goal / Career Pathway</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          My long-term goal is to become a successful software developer by
          improving my knowledge and skills and continuing to grow within the
          industry.

        <h3 className="font-semibold">Strengths and Limitations in Learning</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Strengths:</strong> I can learn quickly, am determined to
          complete tasks, and know when to ask for help.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Limitations:</strong> I am prone to procrastination and
          distractions, sometimes taking extended periods to regain focus. I
          also find that coding or learning late at night works best for me,
          though it can be challenging if support from others isn’t available at
          those times.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold">Human Skills to Develop</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I aim to build confidence, communication, and creativity/imagination,
          as gaps in these areas could hinder my growth as a developer.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold">Commitment to Managing Workload</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
          <li>Be online and working by 8am each day</li>
          <li>Take 15-minute breaks when stuck to problem-solve effectively</li>
          <li>Prioritize coursework over distractions</li>
          <li>Ask for support when needed</li>
          <li>
            Maintain professional and respectful relationships with facilitators
            and learners
          </li>

            Communicate with facilitators if things start to build up and become
            overwhelming
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="font-semibold">Commitment to Seeking Help</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I will ask for help in a timely manner from other learners or
          facilitators via Discord or private messages during their active
          hours.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold">
          Expectations from the Facilitation Team
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I expect guidance to understand problems better, not direct solutions,
          helping me learn to solve them independently.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold">Scheduling / Block-Out Times</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I work part-time, so my block-out times are Monday to Wednesday, 3pm
          to 10:30pm. I will prioritize coursework above extra shifts and
          currently have no other commitments.

          What is Emotional Intelligence?
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is the ability to understand, manage, and
          express your own emotions while also recognizing and responding to the
          emotions of people around you.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">How is EQ Different from IQ?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          EQ differs from IQ in that it focuses on emotional abilities and
          social skills, whereas IQ refers to cognitive abilities like
          problem-solving and analytical thinking.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Why is EQ Important?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          EQ is important because it helps people understand and manage their
          own emotions as well as the emotions of others. High EQ improves
          relationships, enhances decision-making, and contributes to effective
          leadership skills.

          Benefits of Understanding Neuroplasticity
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Neuroplasticity is the idea that our brains don’t stop growing after a
          certain age but are malleable like plastic. This allows us to learn,
          adapt, and strengthen the connections in our brain. By using
          repetitive actions and positive experiences, we can learn new things
          more effectively as these experiences reinforce brain connections,
          improving recall and application of knowledge.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold">
          How I Might Engage with Neuroplasticity
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I plan to engage with neuroplasticity by coding every day, even for
          just an hour or two, and challenging myself with coding problems and
          sprint exercises. This repetitive practice helps build stronger “brain
          connections” through repetition and problem-solving.

        <h3 className="font-semibold">What It Is and Why It’s Relevant</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A Growth Mindset is the belief that a person’s abilities or
          intelligence can improve through perseverance, hard work, and belief
          in oneself. It is relevant because it impacts how we approach
          challenges and learning, which is especially important for students at
          Dev Academy.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold">Personal Reflection</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Nothing particularly surprised me, as I had already learned about
          Fixed vs. Growth Mindsets during high school.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-semibold">Integrating a Growth Mindset</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I feel I already apply a growth mindset in my approach to learning and
          problem-solving, though I will continue to reinforce it throughout my
          development journey.

          Being Blocked on a Simple Problem
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          One time I was blocked during the "gradebook" challenge, where I had
          to add each student from an array into an empty object and then add
          each student’s scores, which were arrays within an array, into the
          student scores key.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The problem-solving techniques I tried included the rubber ducky
          method, pseudocode to break down each part of my code, and asking
          someone for help. I felt slightly overwhelmed because it seemed
          simple, but I kept overcomplicating it by trying to automate too much.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Lesson Learned:</strong> Sometimes the best approach is to
          simplify the problem and not overthink it. Asking someone else to look
          at your code is always helpful.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Elegantly Solving a Problem</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A time I solved a problem elegantly was during the "whereAreYou"
          challenge. I used the Googling method to learn about the{' '}
          <code>.find()</code> method, then applied the rubber duck method to
          implement it successfully. Completing the challenge made me feel
          accomplished and motivated me to explore other JavaScript methods in
          my free time.

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Reluctance to Ask for Help</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          During the "gradebook" challenge, I was initially reluctant to ask for
          help because it seemed like a simple problem and no one else had asked
          in the Discord help channel. I now realize many others had similar
          difficulties but were also hesitant to ask.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Reflection:</strong> Next time, I will be more confident in
